    <h2>HI, I'M TIFFANY</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I'm currently attending Rutgers University and pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I am a graphic designer and web developer for Rutgers Esports. You would most likely find me tapping away at my computer, trying to find the next latest project to commit to. I consider myself like a more visual person more than anything, so I love all things that involve creativity whether that be designing, animation, and developing! I enjoy exploring ideas by just being hands on and start creating. I'm always eager to learn and experience a new perspective because knowledge is infinite so why not just learn new things, it might give extraordinary results.</p>
